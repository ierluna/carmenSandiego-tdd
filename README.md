# carmenSandiego-tdd
Final project from Object Oriented Programming 1 developed entirely in TDD 

Entirely developed  using [Test Driven Development](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/test-driven-development-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not-41fa6bca02a2/).

IDE used: [Cuis University](https://sites.google.com/view/cuis-university) .


## Some details  

During code refactoring, conditional messages (like #ifTrue: or #ifFalse:) were replaced by some desing patterns like [State provider](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state) and [Chain of Responsibility](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility) in order to provide a scalable solution and code much more easy to understand.
